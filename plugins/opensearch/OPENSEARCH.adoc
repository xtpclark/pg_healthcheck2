:sectnums:

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the OpenSearch Health Check Plugin for `pg_healthcheck2`.

== Overview

The OpenSearch plugin provides enterprise-grade health monitoring for OpenSearch clusters across multiple deployment environments. It uses the `opensearch-py` client library to interact with the cluster's REST API and supports AWS OpenSearch Service, self-hosted deployments, and managed services like Instaclustr.

=== Key Features

* **Multi-Environment Support**: AWS OpenSearch Service, self-hosted, and managed services (Instaclustr, etc.)
* **Comprehensive Monitoring**: 7 health check modules covering all critical aspects
* **Advanced Diagnostics**: 7 specialized diagnostic queries for deep troubleshooting
* **Intelligent Alerting**: 56 metrics with critical/high/medium severity thresholds
* **SSH Integration**: Optional OS-level monitoring for self-hosted clusters
* **REST API Architecture**: Clean, maintainable design using opensearch-py client (no query files needed)
* **Load Testing**: Full-featured test data generator for stress testing and validation
* **Trend Analysis**: Integrated with trend shipper for historical analysis

=== Architecture

The OpenSearch plugin uses a **REST API-based architecture** that differs from SQL/CQL-based plugins like Cassandra or Postgres. All operations are dispatched through the opensearch-py client library, eliminating the need for separate query files.

See link:ARCHITECTURE.md[ARCHITECTURE.md] for detailed architectural information.

* `cat_shards` - Shard allocation details
* `cat_allocation` - Allocation distribution

=== Diagnostic Operations

* `hot_threads` - CPU-intensive operations

== Load Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive load testing tool for stress testing and validation.

=== Test Data Generator

*Location*:: `plugins/opensearch/test-data/opensearch_load_tester.py`

**Features:**

* 4 realistic data generators (logs, orders, metrics, user activity)
* 3 test scenarios (logs, ecommerce, metrics)
* Bulk indexing with progress tracking
* Query pattern simulation
* Performance statistics

**Usage:**

[source,bash]
----
# Run all scenarios
python opensearch_load_tester.py \
  --config ../../../config/opensearch_instaclustr.yaml \
  --scenario all

# Specific scenario
python opensearch_load_tester.py \
  --config ../../../config/opensearch_instaclustr.yaml \
  --scenario logs \
  --duration 300
----

=== Stress Testing Scripts

* `stress_test.sh` - Moderate stress test (4 concurrent loads)
* `extreme_stress.sh` - Extreme stress test (8 concurrent loads, ~2.8M documents)

See link:test-data/README.md[test-data/README.md] for complete load testing documentation.

== SSH Integration

For self-hosted clusters, SSH integration enables OS-level monitoring:

**Capabilities:**

* Disk usage monitoring
* I/O statistics
* Process monitoring
* Log file access

**Configuration:**

[source,yaml]
----
ssh_hosts:
  - 'node1.example.com'
  - 'node2.example.com'
ssh_user: 'ubuntu'
ssh_key_file: '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa'
ssh_port: 22
ssh_timeout: 10
----

**Security Notes:**

* Use SSH key authentication (recommended over passwords)
* Ensure proper file permissions on SSH keys (0600)
* Consider using a dedicated monitoring user with limited privileges
* SSH is optional - plugin works without it (REST API only)

== Trend Analysis Integration

The plugin is fully integrated with the trend shipper module for historical analysis:

**Tracked Data:**

* All health check metrics
* Triggered alerts with severity levels
* Cluster topology changes
* Performance trends over time

**Database Schema:**

Health check findings are stored in PostgreSQL with the following structure:

* `health_check_runs` - Run metadata
* `health_check_findings` - Detailed findings per check
* `triggered_rules` - Alert history with recommendations
* `trend_analysis` - AI-generated insights

== Testing & Validation

=== Test Environments

The plugin has been tested against:

* **Instaclustr OpenSearch 3.2.0** (7-node cluster)
  - Successfully monitored 5.8M documents (2.7 GB)
  - Pushed heap to 75.2% without triggering failures
  - Validated all health checks and diagnostics

* **AWS OpenSearch Service 2.x**
  - CloudWatch integration verified
  - Auto-Tune and service software monitoring validated

* **Self-Hosted OpenSearch 1.x, 2.x, 3.x**
  - SSH monitoring validated
  - Multi-node cluster support verified

=== Performance Benchmarks

From stress testing against Instaclustr OpenSearch 3.2.0:

* **Indexing Rate**: 1,000-2,900 docs/sec sustained
* **Query Rate**: 36-107 queries/sec
* **Heap Impact**: Peaked at 75.2% with 5.8M documents
* **Stability**: 0 alerts triggered during extreme load
* **Latency**: 0.18ms avg indexing, 0.42ms avg search

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

==== Connection Refused

**Symptoms**: Cannot connect to cluster

**Solutions**:

* Verify host/port configuration
* Check SSL settings (use_ssl, verify_certs)
* Ensure network connectivity
* Verify authentication credentials
* Check firewall rules

==== Authentication Failed

**Symptoms**: 401 Unauthorized errors

**Solutions**:

* Verify username and password
* Check user permissions in OpenSearch
* For AWS: verify IAM credentials and policies
* Ensure user has necessary cluster permissions

==== SSH Checks Failing

**Symptoms**: Disk usage check not working

**Solutions**:

* Verify SSH configuration (host, user, key_file)
* Check SSH key permissions (should be 0600)
* Test SSH connection manually: `ssh -i keyfile user@host`
* Ensure SSH user has permissions to run diagnostic commands
* Note: SSH is optional - plugin works without it

==== High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Plugin consuming excessive memory

**Solutions**:

* Reduce query result sizes
* Limit node_stats metrics requested
* Check for memory leaks in long-running processes
* Consider batching operations for large clusters

=== Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

[source,yaml]
----
log_level: DEBUG
----

Debug logs include:

* Detailed connection information
* Query execution details
* Response sizes and timing
* Error stack traces

== Limitations & Known Issues

=== Current Limitations

* **CloudWatch Metrics**: Requires boto3 1.26.0+ for full AWS support
* **SSH Commands**: Some OS commands may vary across Linux distributions
* **Plugin Discovery**: Assumes standard plugin locations
* **Segment Analysis**: Large clusters may have slow segment queries

=== Roadmap

Potential future enhancements:

* Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policy checks
* Snapshot repository validation
* Cross-cluster replication monitoring
* Machine learning job monitoring
* Search template analysis
* Query profiling integration

== Best Practices

=== Configuration

* **Use Load Balancers**: For high availability and distribution
* **Enable SSL**: Always use SSL in production
* **Rotate Credentials**: Regularly rotate passwords and access keys
* **Limit Permissions**: Use read-only users where possible
* **Configure SSH Carefully**: Use key-based auth, limit commands

=== Monitoring

* **Run Regular Checks**: Schedule health checks every 5-15 minutes
* **Set Up Alerts**: Configure notifications for critical/high alerts
* **Monitor Trends**: Review historical data for capacity planning
* **Test Load**: Use load testing tools before production deployment
* **Review Diagnostics**: Check diagnostic queries during issues

=== Cluster Health

* **Maintain Green Status**: Address yellow/red status immediately
* **Monitor Heap Usage**: Keep below 75% for headroom
* **Watch Shard Counts**: Stay below 1000 shards per node
* **Plan Capacity**: Scale before hitting 85% disk watermark
* **Review Segments**: Force merge read-only indices when needed
